# Trixels

Trixels is a semi-decentralized application that brings together the world through NFTs. Ever heard of r/place or NounsDAO? Trixels is a mix of both of these cool projects. Users contribute to a pixel canvas which is stored on chain (not right now). Every two weeks (configurable by DAO) the canvas is snapshotted and auctioned off as an NFT. The auction lasts one day and proceeds go to the DAO and to the pixel contributors. The DAO has control over how much goes to the DAO, and how to weight contributions.  

## Design
- Every one day, pixels are updated on-chain
- Every two weeks, a new NFT is minted and auctioned
